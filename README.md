I love cookies big and small, I love cookies I love them all. Do you have cookies? Do you need them eaten? If so, me the monster for the job.

My favorite word? Cookie! My least favorite word? "outofcookies". Me have over 30 years of experience with cookies on Sesame Street. And if you want to see me in action please watch my SNL demo reel where I act, sing and eat cookies
